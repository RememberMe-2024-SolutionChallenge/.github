## **0. Introduction**

RememVR is a service facilitating participation in reminiscence therapy based on VR contents. Our team implemented video-to-VR technology based on AI models, which proves to be significantly more cost-effective than other equipment commonly employed in the creation of existing VR content.

## **1. UN Sustainable Development Goal & Targets**

![SDGs](https://github.com/RememVR-2024-SolutionChallenge/.github/assets/123253883/60b22415-662d-439a-9a6a-15c6e0da3a96)

We chose UN Sustainable Development Goal 3. Especially, we aimed to tackle target 3.4, 3.8, and 3.d. The problem of depression and loneliness is world-wide problem, getting worse with nuclear individualization. To address these problems, we designed a reminiscence therapy service for people suffering from depression by using AI and VR. Our service provide essential health care services. Simultaneously, providing VR contents based on reminiscence therapy would strengthen the capacity for risk reduction and management of depression and loneliness.

## **2. Key Features**

We separated our application into two tracks, caregiver and care recipient tracks are those. Caregivers can make VR scenes and care recipients can experience VR scenes engaging in reminiscence therapy.

### a. Key Features in Caregiver Track

- **(1) Creating VR Scene (Place)**
  - RememVR creates VR experiences encapsulating the places intertwined with a patient's memories. We all live with our unique sense of places, as visiting specific locations can evoke memories from particular times. Places in VR will make them feel as if they are physically present in that space. Caregivers can upload videos showcasing distinctive features of the location if it's indoor, forward-faced, or unbounded.
- **(2) Creating Avatar**
  - RememVR gives avatars representing the patient's cherished individuals. These avatars, combined with place VR scene, offer the patient an immersive recollection of memories. RememVR assists in safeguarding the continuity of the patient's memories. Caregivers can upload a video or an image featuring the person whom they like to transform into an avatar.
- **(3) Creating VR Scene (Avatar + Place)**
  - Caregivers can select avatars, and a VR scene to build a completed VR scene. After VR scene is generated, care recipient can find out that scene in his/her VR experience list.

### b. Key Features in Care recipient Track

- **(1) VR Experience**
  - Care recipients can participate in VR scene. Our character ‚ÄòBrainy‚Äô helps care recipient to follow the steps for VR experience which is a part of the reminiscence therapy. Avatar idles and have various motions. VR scenes are greatly similar to real existing places. Thus, our user can immerse to the VR contents easily.
- **(2) Badge Tracker**
  - After the care recipient completes the VR experience, badges are awarded as part of gamification. These badges can be viewed not only on the Care Recipient's home-page but also on the Caregiver's home. There are a total of three badge designs, and one of them is randomly assigned.
